Roald Dahl


Poetry is completely different to novels in form, structure, and style. It contains a 
wealth of genres in itself, from nonsense verse to war poetry. Poetry has fallen somewhat 
out of favour in modern book sales, though poets like Amanda Gorman and Ocean Vuong are 
repopularising the form.
