Fear of Flying — Erica Jong

Women’s fiction describes books that centre on the experiences and actions of female characters. 
It’s a somewhat controversial term — some people don’t like generalising fiction on a gendered 
basis — but it’s a common way for publishers to market these books. Women’s fiction encompasses 
books as wide-ranging as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Americana to Jojo Moyes’s Me Before You.
