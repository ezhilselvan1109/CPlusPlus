The Adventures of Pinocchio â€” Carlo Collodi

Folk tales date back to ancient times, with Aesop being perhaps the most famous curator 
of these short-form stories. Many fairy tales are actually of unknown origin, but have 
survived through retellings down the generations. Modern fairy tale writers like Angela 
Carter often put a contemporary spin on traditional tales.
