Your Erroneous Zones — Wayne Dyer

Self-help books are probably the most popular modern non-fiction genre, since 
they offer the promise of self-improvement and healing. (This also tends to 
make them a little more expensive than other genres). Books like Dale Carnegie’s 
How To Win Friends and Influence People have become part of the modern self-help canon.
