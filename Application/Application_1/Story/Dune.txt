Dune — Frank Herbert

From Stan Lee to Ursula K Le Guin, there’s no shortage of famous sci-fi writers. 
The genre has grown in popularity thanks to the boom in science fiction films based 
on books, such as Dune and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sci-fi is often combined with fantasy, 
and there are some similarities between these types of books. But sci-fi books are 
usually bound by the laws of science as we know them in the real world.
