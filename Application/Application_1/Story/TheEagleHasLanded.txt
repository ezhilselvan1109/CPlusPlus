The Eagle Has Landed — Jack Higgins

War is a truly formative experience, on an individual, national, and international level. 
Perhaps that’s why stories of war fascinate readers the world over, and remain such an 
enduring theme in modern fiction. War stories are often (though not always) a subset of 
historical fiction.
