William Shakespeare


Plays are written to be performed rather than read, but they’re still seen as a key literary genre. 
This is largely due to the enduring popularity of Shakespeare’s plays, as well as other theatrical 
greats like Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire and Oscar Wilde’s Salome.
