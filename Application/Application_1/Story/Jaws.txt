Jaws — Peter Benchley

People never tire of being terrified — so horror novels remain some of the bestselling books in the world. 
While the genre has origins in Gothic stories like Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, authors like Stephen King 
and R L Stine have modernised horror for adults and children alike. The genre has also spawned hundreds of 
popular horror movies.
