War and Peace — Leo Tolstoy


Literary fiction is reserved for books that don’t slot neatly into more traditional genres, 
although it can also be used to differentiate from lighter fiction. Most literary fiction 
books are character-driven rather than plot-driven, so they tend to be more introspective 
and meandering.
