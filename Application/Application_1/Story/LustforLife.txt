Lust for Life — Irving Stone

There are millions of real-life stories out there just waiting to be told. 
Unlike autobiographies and memoirs, which the author writes about themselves, 
biographies tell the story of someone else’s life. These are often famous 
people — Irving Stone’s Lust For Life, for example, is a biographical novel 
about Vincent Van Gogh — but they can also be people you know, or lesser-known 
individuals of interest.
