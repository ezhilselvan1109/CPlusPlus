Essays are much more academic than other forms of writing. They tend to follow a thesis set by the 
author, and elaborate on their perspective on a particular topic or theme. Essays can be 
book-length (such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s We Should All Be Feminists), or they can be part 
of an essay collection (such as James Baldwin’s Notes of a Native Son).
