Gone Girl — Gillian Flynn

Thrillers are your typical page-turner. Full of action and suspense, thrillers can also often 
cross genres, particularly with crime and mystery. John Grisham, Stieg Larsson, and Gillian 
Flynn are some of the most popular thriller authors writing today, with Flynn’s Gone Girl 
among the top three bestselling books in the genre.
