		Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone â€” JK Rowling

	Fantasy books are probably the most popular modern book genre. Thanks 
to series like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, it's particularly popular with 
young adult readers, although more and more fantasy novels are written for 
adults (George RR Martin, we're looking at you). These stories take readers 
on a journey beyond the known world, to places conjured in the author's imagination.
