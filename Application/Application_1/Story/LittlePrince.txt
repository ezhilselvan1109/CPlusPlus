	The Little Prince is a book that has been translated into English from the French 
language. The author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, was a pilot. Similarly to the pilot in 
his story, while flying a mission during World War II, Antoine de Saint-Exupery's plane 
was shot down, and it disappeared somewhere over the Mediterranean.The Little Prince is 
an honest and beautiful story about loneliness, friendship, sadness, and love. The prince 
is a small boy from a tiny planet (an asteroid to be precise), who travels the universe, 
planet-to-planet,seeking wisdom. On his journey, he discovers the unpredictable nature of 
adults. “All grown-ups were once children… but only a few of them remember it.”

	The story begins on Earth with the narratora crashed pilot stranded in the Sahara 
Desert, who is trying hard to repair his wrecked plane. One day a little boy, oddly dressed, 
shows up out of nowhere and insists that the pilot draw him a sheep. The pilot obeys this 
odd request, which strangely enough leads to the pilot learning more about the Little Prince 
and where he came from. What unfolds is a marvelous story that some will deem happy and some 
will find sad. Either way, all readers will have their minds opened wide and will hopefully 
grow up to be adults that will always remember they were once children, too. The Little Prince 
is a thin book with its mere ninety-eight pages, but don't be fooled; it's a brilliant book 
meant to be deeply thought about and to encourage you to build castles in the air.
