Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban — JK Rowling


Despite being targeted at 13-18 year olds, young adult books have sold more than perhaps 
any other genre in recent years. This is thanks to hugely popular series like Harry Potter, 
The Hunger Games, and Twilight. YA books often have a secondary genre, too — Harry Potter 
and Twilight, for example, are fantasy novels, while John Green’s The Fault In Our Stars 
is a romance.
