The Da Vinci Code — Dan Brown


Mystery is often seen as a subset of the crime genre, but it’s so popular and enduring that it 
deserves a category of its own. Agatha Christie, master of the whodunit, is the second bestselling 
author in history, after William Shakespeare. Mysteries are full of suspense, and usually keep the 
reader guessing until the last moment.
